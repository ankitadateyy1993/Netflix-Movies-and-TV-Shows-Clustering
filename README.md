# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering
* Netflix is the world's largest online streaming service provider with over 220 million subscribers as of 2022-Q2.

* Effective clustering of shows on the Netflix platform is crucial for enhancing the user experience and preventing subscribers churn.

* The goal of the project is to classify/group Netflix shows into clusters based on similarity, allowing for personalized show suggestions to user.

* The dataset used for this project consists of TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019, collected from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine.

* A report from 2018 revealed that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010, while the number of movies has decreased by over 2,000 titles.

* Exploring the dataset can uncover further insights, such as understanding the types of content available in different countries and whether Netflix has shifted its focus more towards TV shows in recent years.

* Integrating external datasets like IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes can provide additional interesting findings.

* Exploratory data analysis can help in understanding the distribution of content types, analyzing trends over time, and identifying patterns or relationships in the data.

* Text-based features can be utilized to cluster similar content, allowing for a better understanding of the relationships between different shows and movies on Netflix.

* Clustering shows on Netflix based on similarity can enable the platform to offer personalized recommendations to users, improving user engagement and satisfaction.

* The dataset from Flixable provides an opportunity to explore the growth and evolution of Netflix's content library, particularly the shift towards producing and acquiring more TV shows.

* Analyzing the distribution of content types in different countries can reveal regional preferences and help Netflix tailor its offerings to specific markets.

* By integrating external datasets such as IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes, Netflix can gain insights into the quality and popularity of its content, which can inform decision-making processes related to acquisitions and content production.

* Clustering shows based on text-based features, such as genre, description, or cast information, can uncover hidden patterns and similarities among different titles, allowing for more targeted content recommendations and a better understanding of user preferences.

* These points provide an overview of the objectives, dataset, insights, and methods involved in the project.
